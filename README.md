# Review Of The Film

### Problem space
The proglem space I am going to tackle is movie
reviews. At first, the goal is to make a system
by which different users can review different
films. Later I am going to be able to allow users
to review a review as to help bring users to
the most helpful reviews

### requirements
#### M.V.P.
A user can review a film. Users must be able to
search for a review by movie. Each user should
also be able to look at the reviews of another
user. Also, film titles should not be duplicated.
#### Stretch
A user should be able to review a review, the
goal being able to talk about how a review was
helpful or not.
